## OED Access

### Conditions of Access

OED respects privacy and recognises its critical importance in an academic setting. As such,
OED does not, in general, intend or wish to access Users’ data except in the following limited
circumstances:

1. For identification or diagnosis of systems or security vulnerability and problems
   in order to preserve the integrity of IT resources.
1. Where there are reasonable grounds to believe that a violation of law or a breach
   of the University’s policies may have taken place, and such access, inspection or
   monitoring may produce evidence of such violation or breach; or
1. Where specifically allowed or required under the laws of Singapore.
1. For manual updating of data in the case that there is system failure and Users’
   data is not the most updated version.

In the above situations, OED or its representatives may access all aspects of the IT resources,
without User consent. Where required, Users agree to provide all necessary assistance to OED or
its representatives in relation to the activities stated above in Section 4 Conditions of Access.

Consistent with privacy interests of the Users, OED access without the consent of the User will
occur only with the approval of President, Provost, or Deputy President or their authorised delegates.
